## Installation / Usage

Please don't. This bot is very much a good utility and if you do wanna use it I cannot stop you from doing so, but there are so many more options (which may include ads),  but they don't require own hosting and they are global for every guild, often with intuitive web interfaces. You can use that instead of this, this was never meant to be used by more people than me, therefore you don't receive any support if you do decide to run it.

You do need a hosting for your discord bot, if you do have one, you can install the bot like so:
1. Make sure your hosting provides the requirements, such as python itself and requirements.txt. Don't forget that you also need a MySQL database.
2. Create an `.env` file, and fill the required data like so:<br>![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1a1O2XsqYWIq3ItXaeyFpaTz8hzKtjBOu)
3. Go to every .py file except the ones in the `/embedy/` folder (those are practically useless and server more like a storage for used embeds) and change the IDs of any variables mentioning roles, text-channels, categories or anything you need to customize. Keep in mind that this bot shouldn't be run by anyone else but me so it can be tough to edit all the variables, especially if they are in Slovak and not English.
4. After you do that, you can just upload everything to your hosting, run `bot.py` and hope for the best, maybe debug a few errors because this isn't meant to be running anywhere else except my PC. Good luck!
